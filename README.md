Bonjour!
My name is Dhruv!
It is a moist,rich in milkchocolate World Famous cake by yours truly Master chef Dhruv.
I first mix up my mind on how to make the cake, like what ingredients to add first, I know it sounds a bit weird but I like to add something special you now to add upp the taste.

Ingredients: 3 cups of Flour, 3 cups of sugar, 1 cup and 2 TBSP OF cocoa, 3 spoons of Ancient family milkchocolate delisish powder(secret)!, 1 cup of melted Cadbury (dairymilk silk), 3 tsp Baking Soda, 3 large eggs, 1 1/2 cup of Milk, 1 1/4 cups of Oil, 2 tsp Vanilla, 1 1/2 cups of boiling water.

Recipe: Preheat oven to 145ºC. Line and grease two 9” round cake tins. Combine dry ingredients, in mixer bowl. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla, and beat at medium speed until JUST combined. Add the boiling water and mix immediately by hand until the batter is smooth (don’t over mix). Pour into the two prepared 9” cake tins. Tap tins once, firmly on the counter to reduce large bubbles in the mix. Bake for 60 mins, until the cake just begins to pull away from the sides of the tin, and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks. Once the cakes are completely cool, tops can be levelled (if necessary) and cakes can be filled, stacked and decorated. ADD YOUR OWN TOPPINGS! WARNING![THIS RECIPE IS A PROJECT/EXPERIMENT (DO NOT COOK!)]
